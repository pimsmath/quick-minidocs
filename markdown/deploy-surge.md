## How to rapidly deploy using [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/)?

I installed [surge](http://surge.sh/) and created my account on [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/).

I ran `surge` inside the `site` directory. During the surge wizard process, I edited the automatically generated URL to read [http://quick-minidocs.surge.sh](http://quick-minidocs.surge.sh).
