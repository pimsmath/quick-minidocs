### Mathematical Notation?

In principle, insertion of this script in the `<head>` will render TeX expressions into mathematical notation:

```<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>```

$$ \LaTeX $$

It doesn't work at this time so this extensions is a *work in progress*.
